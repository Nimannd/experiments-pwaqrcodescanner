# QR Code Scanner Experiment
This repository contains a simple experiment to create a QR code scanner using Browser technologies like React, Angular, or Javascript.
It should use the device camera to scan QR codes and add each decoded number to a list displayed on the screen.
The App should only be Web based and should not require any native app installation.

## Core Aspects to consider
- Use of Web APIs to access the device camera.
- Use of a QR code decoding library which is open source and/or free to use.
- The speed on how many QR codes can be scanned in a given time frame.
- The accuracy of the QR code decoding. Any misreads lead to business errors.
